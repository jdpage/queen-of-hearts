# *The Queen of Hearts*
Final project for MUS 306


## Program Notes
*The Queen of Hearts* is a piece for solo voice. Based on *Alice in Wonderland*
by Lewis Carroll, a.k.a. mathematician Charles Dodgson, it re-imagines the
dialogue of the Queen of Hearts. Taking the themes of the book to extremes,
on the surface it makes only fleeting sense, while being built around a rigid
mathematical structure based on Julia sets generalized to a finite ring of
Gaussian integers.

Sections of the score may not be reused, and once performed once must be regenerated
before another performance. A subset of the score to perform is to be selected by
a simple audience participation activity involving playing cards. The performer is
not to be shown the score in advance, and must rehearse using stale copies.


## Building

Requires [`unfolded-cycle`](https://github.com/jdpage/unfolded-cycle) and
[`math-ring`](https://github.com/jdpage/math-ring).
